To use these messages files edit the language option in the
e2guardian.conf file.

If your language is not here, please email author/e2guardian.org
with your translation and it will be included in a later release.

Or, if you want to improve the existing messages we will consider
using ones you submit instead.

When editing, the line may not contain a " as this is used to
denote the start and end.  Instead use a '.
